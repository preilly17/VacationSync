Vacation Group Calendar App - Replit Build Prompt
Project Overview
Build a collaborative vacation calendar app where group members can post activities like a shared Google Calendar, others can accept/decline, and accepted activities automatically populate personal travel calendars with smart notifications.
Core Concept
Think Google Calendar meets Eventbrite for vacation groups - anyone can propose activities, everyone can see what's available, and your personal calendar only shows what you've accepted.
Core Features
1. User Account System

Individual user accounts with email/password authentication
User profiles: name, email, phone number, timezone
Push notification preferences

2. Trip Calendar Creation

Anyone can create a "Trip Calendar" - shared calendar for the group
Trip details: destination, dates, calendar name
Invitation system: Share calendar link or invite via email
Multiple people can be "co-organizers" with posting privileges

3. Collaborative Activity Posting

Anyone in group can post activities to the shared trip calendar
Activity details:

Name and description
Date and time (start/end)
Location (address with map integration)
Estimated cost per person
Maximum group size (optional)
Category tags (food, sightseeing, transport, etc.)
Photos or links for reference



4. Accept/Decline System

Each activity shows as a "proposal" on shared calendar
Simple "Accept" / "Decline" buttons for each activity
Real-time participant count - see who else is going
Participant list - names of people who accepted
Comments section - ask questions or suggest modifications

5. Personal Travel Calendar

Accepted activities automatically appear on your personal calendar
Only shows activities you've accepted - clean, personalized view
Calendar integration - export to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar
Daily agenda view - clean timeline of your accepted activities
Conflict detection - warns if activities overlap

6. Smart Notifications

1 hour notice: "Museum visit starts in 1 hour at Tokyo National Museum"
30 minute notice: "Meet at Shibuya Station in 30 minutes for dinner"
New activity alerts: "Sarah posted a new activity: Karaoke Night"
Activity updates: "Temple visit moved to 2 PM"
Capacity alerts: "Only 2 spots left for cooking class"

7. Real-Time Collaboration

Live updates when people accept/decline activities
Activity modifications - poster can update details, participants get notified
Group chat per activity - coordinate meeting details
Status updates - "Running 10 minutes late" for accepted activities

Activity Planning

Notifications: Get 1-hour and 30-minute reminders

During Trip

Real-Time Updates: Activity changes notify all participants
Coordination: Use activity chat for meeting details
Status Updates: Let group know if you're running late

Flexibility - people can opt in/out easily
Transparency - everyone sees all options

For Individual Users

Personalized calendar - only see what you're doing
Automatic organization - no manual calendar management
Smart notifications - never miss activities you want to join
Conflict prevention - warns about overlapping commitments

For Trip Dynamics

Reduces FOMO - see all options before deciding
Enables sub-groups naturally - different people accept different activities
Cost transparency - know expenses upfront
Realistic planning - capacity limits prevent over-booking

Development Priorities
